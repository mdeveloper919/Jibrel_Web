For this reason, Ethereum is well suited to form the foundation of jibrel\’s underlying architecture. Mining rewards will be in the form of Ethereum gas, while any tethered token will not be part of the mining process.\n\n While jibrel is also suited to be built on Bitcoin\’s Omniprotocol, that approach is beyond the scope of this paper.'
