const jdb = 'The JDB will receive / hold traditional assets on behalf of their owners and issue their respective CryDRs. Upon receipt of the asset off-chain, the JDB issues a token andsends it to the ownerâ€™s wallet. Upon redemption of a token, the token is destroyed and the underlying asset is transferred to the token holder.\n\nWhile the JDB aims to be fully decentralized, until full on-chain integration of traditional financial institutions, large components of the system will need to be off-chain. Off-chain activity will require the input and oversight of local and international regulators. \n\nFor this reason, stakeholder interaction must be properly managed to ensure full regulatory compliance without sacrificing transparency and reliability. This will be achieved through asset portals, dedicated entities operating with full compliance in their respective geographies.'
