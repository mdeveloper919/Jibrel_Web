const Traditional = 'The core stakeholders in the jibrel ecosystem are; non-investment users, who seek to benefit from the value unlocked by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, such as low remittance fees and instant transfers; traditional investors, who seek to benefit from the high returns of the emerging cryptoeconomy; and decentralized organizations \/ funds and crypto-investors, who seek to diversify their crypto-holdings with stable low-yield assets, on-chain, as to remain transparent to crowd-funders.\n \nThe needs of all stakeholders could be successfully met by bringing the stability of traditional financial instruments to the blockchain. This can be accomplished by minting tethered tokens with one-to-one backing of the underlying traditional asset they represent. Using such a method, tethered tokens can be used to denote a currency[5] or even a commodity[6].\n \nBy developing a ‘guarantor’ that houses traditional assets and issues tokens representing ownership of the underlying assets, one can enable a wide-range of currencies, commodities, money market instruments and other financial tools, to be openly traded on-chain.\n'
