const ethereum = 'Since their introduction with Bitcoin in 2009[1], blockchains have unlocked tremendous value. With this new technology, we can verify and commit transactions in an immutable decentralized ledger, or implemented more broadly, achieve decentralized consensus.\n\nThis incredible innovation is currently transforming our world by eroding the need for trusted intermediaries, settlement \/ clearing offices, and middle-man service providers  across a wide range of industries and sectors.\n\nThat being said, due to limited adoption at an institutional level, most of the crypto-economy\'s value remains siloed by use-case or geography. In addition, widespread systemic risk exists due to the bottlenecks imposed by these siloes in the form of challenges and limitations in converting between traditional assets and digital assets.\n\nGiven the disconnect between the traditional economy and the cryptoeconomy, the same challenges plaguing the former still persist in the latter. Users wishing to transfer traditional currency between one another still face the time delays and fees imposed by relying on a combination of cryptocurrency exchanges, traditional financial institutions, as well as payment processors.\n\nMoreover, traditional individual and institutional investors, who could facilitate the quick movement of traditional assets off-chain are deterred from participating due to the fundamental incompatibilities that exist - most notably, a lack of transparency and extreme market volatility[2].\n\nFinally, decentralized organizations, who raise funding through crowd sales, as well as decentralized funds and crypto-investors, who are overexposed in digital assets and cryptocurrencies, have limited options to diversify into traditional holdings.\n\nThe risks are compounded further by the fact that digital currencies play a multifaceted role, they are used to reward miners for facilitating transactions; as a means of transferring value; as a speculative investment tool; and most recently, to crowdfund and run decentralized organizations and applications (e.g. decentralized computing[3], decentralized storage[4]). \n\nIn traditional finance, different instruments are used for these functions and are regulated accordingly. This helps manage systemic risk. Until decentralized regulatory consensus protocols are fully built-out, the cryptoeconomy faces security and fraud risk, in the form of unregulated exchanges; market risks, resulting from extremely volatile currencies that are used beyond their architectured purpose; and systemic risks arising from crowd-funds stored in volatile digital currencies and subsequently locked into smart contracts.\n\nThis paper analyzes the limitations and challenges of the current environment and proposes an approach that leverages existing infrastructure to provide a solution for all stakeholders.'
