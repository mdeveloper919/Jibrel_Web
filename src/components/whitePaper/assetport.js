const assetport = 'Asset portals are used to undertake the necessary legal and financial steps to convert traditional assets into on-chain digital assets.\nFiat portals will be simple cryptocurrency exchanges. Strategic partnerships can be formed with existing exchanges while a dedicated jibrel exchange network with sufficient geographic reach can be built-out. In addition, by housing a portion of jibrel\â€™s fiat reserves in existing exchanges, transfer times and fees are significantly reduced whilst simultaneously providing exchanges with much needed liquidity.\n\nNon-fiat portals will require off-chain presence to undertake the necessary due diligence and take ownership of non-fiat deposits.\n\nIn most geographies, asset portals will require brokerage and money transmitter licenses. In cases involving heavily regulated jurisdictions or more nuanced financial assets, full regulator involvement and oversight might be required.\n\n As regulation evolves, asset portals will be able to decentralize and become community driven. Institutional investors and other financial institutions will be able to list their own traditional assets on-chain, using the jibrel platform.'
